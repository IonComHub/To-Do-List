# To-Do-List
This is my first coding project. It has educational purposes - to build up my programming skills and learn to work with GitHub.
The progect starts as a simple to-do list for a student (where the inspiring prototype is my fifth-grade son). 
In the course of the next weeks my intention is to develop it step-by-step.
